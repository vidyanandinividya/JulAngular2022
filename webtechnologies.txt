The client uses a web browser to send request to the server.
The server sends a response back to the browser with a set of instructions written in HTML

Website
    collection of static files i.e. web pages such as HTML pages, images, graphics etc
Web Application
    It is a website with dynamic functionality on the server
    Google, Facebook,Twitter
HTTP
    is a protocol which is used by the clients and servers on the web to communicate
    It is a stateless protocol i.e it supports only one request per connection
Get
    Data is sent in the header body
    Restricted to limited data transfer
    It is not secured
    It can be bookmarked
Post
    Data is sent in the request body
    Supports a large amount of data transfer
    It is completely secured
    It cannot be bookmarked   
Servlet
    It is a Java class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications by means of a request-response programming model
    It is a web component that is displayed on the server to create dynamic web page.
Steps to Create Servlet
    Create a directory structure
    Create a Servlet
    Compile the Servlet
    Add mappings to the web.xml file
    Start the server and deploy the project
    Access the Servlet
Servlet Life Cycle
    The Servlet class is loaded
    The Servlet instance is created
    The init() method is invoked in order to initialize the Servlet
    The service() method is invoked repeatedly for each client request placed
    The Servlet is destroyed using destroy() method

    init()
        whenever a user invokes the URL associated with a particular servlet, the init() method is called
        it is called only once and not each time there is a request.
    service()
        It is an important method that will get called every time when a request recieved for the servlet
    destroy()
        This method is also called just once at the end of the servlet life cycle.
        It helps perform all the clean-up activities including database connections, halting background threads, etc
        It removes the servlet from the container
In older version HTTP Servlet imported from the package javax.servlet.HttpServlet
In new version HTTP Servlet imported from the package jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
RequestDispatcher
    It is an interface which provides the facility of dispatching the request or including the request.

    forward() : Forwards a request from a servlet to another resource (servlet, JSP file, HTML file) on the server
    include() : Includes the content of a resource (Servlet, JSP file, HTML file) in the response.
sendRedirect()
    This method of HttpServletResponse interface can be used to redirect the response to another resource (servelet, JSP file, HTML file)
Session Management
    It is a mechanism used by Web container to store session information for a particular user.
    The session is mainly used for time duration for the client and server interaction
    we can track the data using session tracking to maintain the user data in a particular state.
