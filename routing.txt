Router Outlet
    Router outlet is a built-in directive
    Every Angular app should have atleast one router outlet
    By Default - the router outlet is defined in app.component.html
    Router outlet will match the matching routes for the component
        takes it output
            insert inside the page
    we can define multiple router outlets by giving name to them
    that's why we call them named router outlet
    in routing module- if you don't define outlet -- it means it's primary
    It will not show if you directly access it in the URL
    Syntax
    http://localhost:4200/<primary-route>(<routerOutletName>:<secondaryPath>)

    Routing behaviour of the application URLs
    Angular provode 2 routing strategies

    --  PathLocationStrategy
        Default routing startegy for Angular apps
        HTML 5 push state URL
        http://myapp.com/dashboard
        http://myapp.com/user/10
        http://myapp.com/user/photos

    --  HashLocationStrategy
        URL segments/patters
        URLs will have hash in the URLs
        http://myapp.com/#/dashboard
        http://myapp.com/#/user/10
        http://myapp.com/#/user/photos

       /#/loans/add --> folder

Base HREF is mandatory for all angular apps
Base HREF is present in your index.html
The project is pointing to the "root" directory/folder of your server which is routing
when you are deploying Angular apps to server
    --> root server
    http://myapp.com

    http://myapp.com/app1/

It decides where you want to deploy your app
    -- that's why it's extremly important

Routing Module is a placeholder for configuring all routes and navigations in one module
we can generate the app routing module using the CLI
    ng g m app-routing --flat -module=app

Any unmatched route will be intercepted by wild card route
This has to be the last route in your application
we define by saying the path to match "**"
